<h1> Neural networks design for chess</h1>


Given the spatial nature of chess, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a natural choice. They can capture patterns and relationships between pieces on the board.



1. Input Layer:

The input to the network will be the tensor representation of the chessboard, which is of shape (8, 8, 12) as we discussed in the preprocessing section.

2. Convolutional Layers:

These layers will help the network recognize patterns on the board. For instance, recognizing when pieces are attacking each other or identifying common opening positions.

  <strong>
  model.add(tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', padding='same', input_shape=(8, 8, 12)))
  model.add(tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization())
  model.add(tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(128, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', padding='same'))
  model.add(tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization())
  </strong>

3. Fully Connected (Dense) Layers:

After the convolutional layers, you can flatten the output and pass it through one or more dense layers. These layers will help in making the final decision about the best move.

  <strong>
  model.add(tf.keras.layers.Flatten())
  model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(256, activation='relu'))
  model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5))
  model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'))
  </strong>

4. Output Layer:

The output layer's size depends on how you represent the possible moves. One common approach is to have an output neuron for each square on the board (64 squares) for each piece (6 pieces for each color). This results in 64 * 12 = 768 possible moves. However, not all these moves are valid, but the network will learn to assign lower probabilities to invalid moves.


  <strong>model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(768, activation='softmax'))</strong>

The softmax activation ensures that the output values are probabilities that sum up to 1.

5. Compile the Model:

Choose an optimizer, loss function, and metrics for training.


<strong>model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])</strong>









<h2>Extra documentation</h2>

<h3>Convolutional Layers:</h3>

Convolutional layers are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images. In the context of a chessboard, they can recognize patterns such as threatened pieces, control of the center, pawn structures, and more.

    Kernel Size: This is the size of the filter that the layer will learn. A 3x3 kernel is common, but you can experiment with 5x5 or even 7x7. The kernel size determines how many squares on the board the network looks at simultaneously.

    Activation Function: The ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function is a popular choice for CNNs. It introduces non-linearity into the model, allowing the network to learn from the error and make adjustments, which is essential for learning complex patterns.

    Padding: 'Same' padding means we pad the input volume with zeros on the border to allow the convolutional layer to produce an output volume of the same size as the input.

<h3>Batch Normalization:</h3>

Batch normalization can make deep networks faster to train. It normalizes the activations of the neurons, which can lead to a more stable and faster convergence.
Fully Connected (Dense) Layers:

After the convolutional layers, the data is flattened and passed through one or more dense layers. These layers perform classification based on the features extracted by the convolutions.

    Dropout: Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, reducing overfitting. The value 0.5 means that approximately half of the inputs will be dropped out or set to zero.


<h3>Hyperparameters: </h3>

Hyperparameters are parameters whose values are set before training a model, as opposed to the parameters (like weights and biases) which are learned during training.

    Learning Rate: This is one of the most crucial hyperparameters. It determines the step size at each iteration while moving towards a minimum of the loss function. If it's too large, the model might overshoot the minimum. If it's too small, the model might need too many iterations to converge or might get stuck.

    Batch Size: This is the number of training examples utilized in one iteration. A smaller batch size often provides a regularizing effect and lower generalization error.

    Number of Epochs: An epoch is one forward pass and one backward pass of all the training examples. The number of epochs is the number of times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset.

    Optimizer: Algorithms used to change the attributes of the neural network such as weights and learning rate to reduce the losses. Adam is a popular choice; it combines the best properties of the AdaGrad and RMSProp algorithms.

    Loss Function: This measures how far off our predictions are from the actual values. For multi-class classification problems like this, categorical_crossentropy is commonly used.

    Initializers: These define the way to set the initial random weights of Keras layers. For deep networks, it's crucial to initialize them with a method that helps in faster convergence.

Example Adjustments:

    Learning Rate Adjustment: You can use learning rate schedules or adaptive learning rate methods. For instance, decreasing the learning rate as the training progresses can be beneficial.


  <strong> from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam 

          optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=0.001, decay=1e-6)
          model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
  </strong>

    Different Optimizer: You can try the RMSprop optimizer, which adjusts the Adagrad method in a very simple way in an attempt to reduce its aggressive, monotonically decreasing learning rate.


from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import RMSprop
<strong>
    optimizer = RMSprop(learning_rate=0.001, rho=0.9, epsilon=1e-08, decay=0.0)
    model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
</strong>

    Different Initialization: He initialization can be effective when using the ReLU activation function.


<strong>model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(256, activation='relu', kernel_initializer='he_normal'))</strong>

Remember, tuning hyperparameters is more of an art than a science. It often requires multiple experiments and patience. Tools like TensorBoard can be invaluable for tracking these experiments and visualizing the training process.
